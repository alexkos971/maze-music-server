# MAZE-MUSIC

Web-application music servies, like [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/)

> Initially, the idea was to create a regular player but with the ability to upload your tracks to the cloud using some API, such as telegram. But then, it turned into a whole music service, with the ability to view a selection of artists to your liking.
